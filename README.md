# Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation

🔐 A simple Python project that encrypts and decrypts images by manipulating pixel values using XOR operations.

## 💡 Description

This tool hides image data by applying a secret key to each pixel's RGB values. When the same key is applied again, the image is decrypted back to its original form.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- Pillow (`PIL`)

## 📁 Features

- Image Encryption (XOR-based)
- Image Decryption using the same key
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Pillow:
2. 
2. Replace `"your_image.jpg"` in the code with your actual image file.

3. Run the script:
4. 
4. You’ll get:
- `encrypted_image.jpg`
- `decrypted_image.jpg`

## 🔐 Output Example

> Before encryption: clear image  
> After encryption: scrambled/unreadable  
> After decryption: original image restored

## 📚 Learning Outcome

- Image data protection using pixel manipulation
- XOR encryption logic
- File I/O and RGB handling with Python
